# Sentimental-Analysis-of-IMDB-dataset
Introduction
This data set is a set of movie reviews which is similar to what data analysts at IMDB handle. Solving this assignment will give you an idea about how problems are systematically solved using NLP.

 

Business Understanding

Movie reviews are an important way to gauge the performance of a movie. While providing a numerical/stars rating to a movie tells us about the success or failure of a movie quantitatively, a collection of movie reviews is what gives us a deeper qualitative insight into different aspects of the movie.

 

A textual movie review tells us about the strong and weak points of the movie and a deeper analysis of a movie review can tell us if the movie, in general, meets the expectations of the reviewer.

 

Business Objectives

In this assignment, we aim to use Sentiment Analysis on a set of movie reviews given by reviewers and try to understand what their overall reaction to the movie was, i.e. if they liked the movie or they hated it.

We aim to utilize the relationships of the words in the review to predict the overall polarity of the review.
